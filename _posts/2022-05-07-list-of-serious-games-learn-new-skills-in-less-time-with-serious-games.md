# What are Serious Games?
One of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikalisches_W%C3%BCrfelspiel" target="_blank">Bach's students</a> developed one of the earliest serious games. In this game, the participant roll dices and combine musical fragments into a song.
Serious games are defined as games with additional pedagogical value.
The main challenge is creating a strong immersion while the player learns new skills.

> Serious games should not be confused with Gamification, which takes existing activities and intensifies learning satisfaction. There is no immersion.

How far can we push games into the pedagogical realm while keeping players immersed? What's even <i>immersion</i>?
